# Detection_of_Plant_Diseases_using_CNN
A Convolutional Neural Network Approach for Early Detection of Plant Diseases Using Leaf Imagery . This paper introduces a CNN model for early plant disease detection using leaf images. The model effectively classifies diseases by learning subtle patterns, providing high accuracy in early diagnosis to help improve crop health monitoring and yield outcomes
